The IDE I used to create the project is Intellij and the version of java is SDK 1.8. To run the game 
you may need to set the compiler output and link the "res" folder via the "project structure" -> "modules" -> "dependicies"
then click the "+" button and link "res" folder. I am not sure by what you meant by current working directory relative to github
repo but my current working directory for the project is "~/Desktop/IdeaProjects/TankGame".

Also the game may not open sometimes because of a thread exception and the FPS may be low when opening the game.

The controls for my game is:
Player1: 
Q -> Counter Clock wise rotation
E -> Clock wise rotation
W -> North
S -> South
A -> West
D -> East
Space -> Shoot

Player2:
"|" (under backspace) -> Clock wise rotation
Shift -> Counter clock wise rotation
Enter -> Shoot
Up key -> north
Down key -> south
Left key -> west
Right key -> east
